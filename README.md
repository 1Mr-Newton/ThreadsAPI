## Threads Python API Wrapper

This Python package provides a convenient way to interact with the Threads API. Threads is a social media platform, and this package allows you to perform various actions programmatically, such as logging in, posting, liking, deleting, and more.

### Installation

You can install the Threads Python API Wrapper using pip:

```bash
pip install threads-python-api
```

### Usage

First, import the Threads class from the package:

```python
from threads_python_api import Threads
```

Then, initialize the Threads class with your Threads username and password:

```python
threads = Threads(username="your_username", password="your_password")
```

#### Logging In

To authenticate with Threads, you can use the `login` method:

```python
threads.login()
```

#### Posting Threads

You can create new threads with text, images, or videos using the `create_thread` method:

```python
message = "Hello, Threads!"
media_paths = ["path/to/image.jpg", "path/to/video.mp4"]  # Optional
threads.create_thread(message=message, media_path=media_paths)
```

#### Liking and Unliking Threads

To like a thread, use the `like` method, and to unlike, use the `unlike` method:

```python
post_id = "thread_id_here"
threads.like(post_id)
threads.unlike(post_id)
```

#### Deleting Threads

To delete a thread, use the `delete_thread` method:

```python
thread_id = "thread_id_here"
threads.delete_thread(thread_id)
```

#### Other Actions

The package also provides methods for actions such as reposting, un-reposting, following, unfollowing, blocking, unblocking, muting, and unmuting users.

### Example

```python
from threads_python_api import Threads

threads = Threads(username="your_username", password="your_password")
threads.login()

# Posting a new thread
message = "Hello, Threads!"
media_paths = ["path/to/image.jpg", "path/to/video.mp4"]  # Optional
threads.create_thread(message=message, media_path=media_paths)

# Liking a thread
post_id = "thread_id_here"
threads.like(post_id)

# Unliking a thread
threads.unlike(post_id)

# Deleting a thread
thread_id = "thread_id_here"
threads.delete_thread(thread_id)

# Reposting a thread
threads.repost(thread_id)

# Un-reposting a thread
threads.unrepost(thread_id)

# Following a user
username_to_follow = "username_here"
threads.follow(username=username_to_follow)

# Unfollowing a user
threads.unfollow(username=username_to_follow)

# Blocking a user
threads.block(username=username_to_block)

# Unblocking a user
threads.unblock(username=username_to_unblock)

# Muting a user
threads.mute(username=username_to_mute)

# Unmuting a user
threads.unmute(username=username_to_unmute)
```

### Notes
